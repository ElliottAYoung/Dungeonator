# Dungeonator

This is a fairly basic, niche gem that will create a semi-random Dungeon/ One-Shot D&D campaign name based on a series of pre-determined words.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dungeonator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dungeonator

## Usage

There is only one command - Dungeonator.dungeon_name, which will return a String of the Dungeon's name. Nice and Easy.
